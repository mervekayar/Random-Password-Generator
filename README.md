# PyPassword Generator – Python (Learning Project)

This is a simple password generator written in Python.

## Description
The program generates a random password based on user-defined criteria.
The user specifies how many letters, symbols, and numbers the password should contain.
The characters are then randomly selected and shuffled to create a secure password.

## Purpose
This project was created during my early Python learning phase to practice:
- Working with lists
- Using loops (`for`)
- Generating random values with the `random` module
- Handling user input
- Building strings dynamically
- Understanding basic algorithmic thinking

## Features
- User-defined password length
- Includes letters, numbers, and symbols
- Randomized character order for stronger passwords
- Console-based interaction

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
